        Tobex international high school is a four-year comprehensive high school
        with approximately 5,300 students in grades nine through twelve. It is
        fully accredited by the Indiana Department of Education and the North
        Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement.
        The high school is part of the Carmel Clay Schools District and--along
        with three middle schools and eleven elementary schools--serves the city
        of Carmel and the township of Clay in southwestern Hamilton County,
        Indiana, just north of Indianapolis. In addition to eighteen counselors,
        two media specialists, three nurses, and twelve administrators, the
        professional staff at Carmel High School includes over 300 classroom
        teachers. Over half the teachers have ten or more years professional
        experience, and more than one in five have twenty or more years'
        experience. Another 400 employees in a range of clerical, custodial,
        food service, technical, and other support positions bring the total
        high school staff up to over 700. A typical day of classes at Carmel
        High School begins at 9:05 a.m. and ends at 4:05 p.m. Classes are
        arranged on a block eight schedule of four 90-minute periods per regular
        school day. One period of Student Support Resource Time (SSRT) is built
        into each eight-block rotation. Four 27-minute lunch sessions are
        offered during third block each day. Ten minutes is allowed for passing
        periods between classes. This year students may attend a hybrid model
        (in-person/virtual) or a virtual only model. Portions of the existing
        Carmel High School facility were first opened in 1958. Significant
        expansions and renovations were completed in 1961, 1969, 1977, 1999,
        2005, and 2013. The CHS complex sits on 55 acres of land and has
        1,046,572 square feet under roof on campus.
